# Overview of Structure and Approach

This project is designed exclusively for desktop screens and uses semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>,) to maintain a clear and accessible document structure.
The layout relies on CSS Grid and Flexbox for alignment and spacing, with no use of floats.

# Breakpoints Used
Desktop (1024px and above)
No tablet or mobile breakpoints are implemented, as the design targets desktop resolution only.

# Assumptions and Limitations

The layout is not optimized for mobile or tablet devices.

Best viewed on modern desktop browsers (Chrome).

Content and images are assumed to fit within desktop viewport widths without overflow.
